 (You walk down the basement stairs. It’s quiet and damp here. It looks untouched, not wrecked like the rest of the house./Once you reach the bottom of the steps, you hear the door slam shut above you.)//???: Hello Master.//(You turn and see the ghost of a teenage boy. His image flickers, and his body looks thin, scrawny, on the edge of emaciated. Half his face is covered in angry red scarring, with dry patches where layers of skin are seared away pockmarking his cheeks and forehead.//Suddenly you remember who he is. The servant. The one who never seemed to be able to meet your standards, whether it was the temperature of your tea or sneaking off the grounds when he wasn’t working.)//You…?//Servant: Yes. Me, master. Don’t you remember what happened here?//(Your memory is fuzzy. You get vague pangs of heat, loud crackling, the smell of something off. Of a scream for help. You remember the diary pages, with the accounts of what you did to the servant. How you treated him. Of the electric problems in the house.)//A… a fire. I remember a fire.//Servant: Yes. //(You begin putting the pieces together.)//A fire started in the living room. Because the wiring hadn’t been working recently near the fireplace. And you--//Servant: I didn’t survive. I died choking on smoke, feeling the most searing, excruciating pain. //And it was my fault… I… I’d locked you into your room.//Servant: Yes. I’m glad you remember.//I…/What was your name?//(The servant freezes for a moment, confused and unprepared for the question. He looks down sadly.)//Servant: I… I don’t remember… //(Your head hurts, but you are trying your very best to remember.)//It…/It was…//[1] Samuel  [2] Freddy
N ///Freddy. It was Freddy.//(Freddy looks up at you, his tortured gaze softening. He smiles softly.)//Freddy, I’m so-//(He cuts you off. /He sees the knife sticking out of your bag. /His tone changes.)//Freddy: …What is that?//[1] Play it off  [2] Pull it out
Y ///Was it… Samuel?//(The servant looks at you, pained.)//???: …No, that doesn’t feel right…//(Suddenly his expression changes.)//SERVANT: …What is that?//(The SERVANT points to the knife sticking out of your bag.)//[1] Play it off [2] Pull it out
NY ///Nothing! It’s nothing, just something I picked up along the way…//(Freddy doesn’t believe you./He takes a few steps back, his hands balling into fists).//Freddy: …//Freddy:...Liar.//(You curse yourself for not realizing sooner that you were dealing with a Vengeful Spirit. You know better than to approach one with any signs of hostility.)//[1] Reason with him. [2] Get ready to fight.

NN ///(You pull out the knife from your bag, ready to explain how you just happened to pick it up in the kitchen, but the moment you grip it in your hands in front of you, Freddy steps back./He looks angry.)//Freddy: …I can’t believe you. //(He puts his hands on his head.)//Freddy: I can’t believe you!! And I started to trust you!//Freddy: God, I can’t believe I fell for it, just because you remember my name doesn’t mean you finally see me as a person!!!//(Freddy is becoming increasingly unstable.)/(You need to do something, fast.)//[1] Reason with him. [2] Get ready to fight.
