 (You walk down the basement stairs. It’s quiet and damp here. It looks untouched, not wrecked like the rest of the house.)//???: Hello Master.//(You turn and see the ghost of a teenage boy. His image flickers, and his body looks thin, scrawny, on the edge of emaciated. Half his face is covered in angry red scarring, with dry patches where layers of skin are gone, pockmarking his cheeks and forehead. He looks familiar somehow, but the scarring makes it hard to recognize him.)//Who are you?//???: You don’t even know who I am? Wow. This will be harder than I thought.//(You get angry.)//I’m sorry that I don’t recognize some random person in my basement. What are you doing here?//???: Ah yes, because the best thing I have to do with my afterlife is hang out in the place where I suffered and died. Let me enlighten you. I’m your servant. You remember? Or “idiot,” “useless,” “dimwit,” any of the other things you liked to call me. Do you remember what happened here? Why I’m like this?//(Your memory is fuzzy. You get vague pangs of heat, loud crackling, the smell of something off.)//I… I don’t. What happened to you? How are you a ghost?//Servant: HA. Of course you don’t know. //[1] What do you want from me?  [2] Get out of this house, demon!
Y ///(You ask the spirit what it wants from you.)//???: God, you’re pathetic!//Look, I- it seems like I did something, but I truly don’t remember, so just, tell me what you want and I’ll leave you alone or whatever it is you want!//(The spirit stares back at you with a look of disgust.)//???: You know, I tried to help you./???: I tried to get you to realize./???: I left you so many hints around this stupid, awful house. /???: You couldn’t even bother to find your own stupid journal entries.//I- I did!//???: Not all of them, clearly. //(The spirit takes a moment.)//???: I really did try./???: You’re beyond saving.//(You are confused and afraid. You need to do something, fast.)// [1] Tell me what I did. [2] (Attack the spirit)
N ///(You yell at the phantasm.)//It just stares back.//???: Pathetic. The great Nathan Smith can’t even tell what type of spirit I am./???: Go on. Guess.//You…/You’re a…//[1] Vengeful Spirit  [2]Poltergeist
YY (You plead with the spirit, asking it to tell you what it is that you did./It thinks for a moment.)//???: …/???: No. /???: You deserve to live with this uncertainty./???:.../???: I hope when you wake up, the only thing you can remember is that empty, awful feeling of guilt in your chest/???: and that you never are able to remember why it’s there in the first place./[1] Wake up. [2] Wake up.
YN ///(You charge at the spirit, fist raised and strike it in the face, before realizing that your fist simply went straight through.)//???: A veteran ghost hunter like you would know better than to approach a Vengeful Spirit with hostility./???: …/???: I won’t let you hurt me again./???: And all you had to do…/???: …was apologize. //(The spirit runs at you suddenly at a supernatural speed./(It’s over in an instant.) //[1] Wake up. [2] Wake up.
