 (It’s quiet and damp down here. It looks untouched, not wrecked like the rest of the house./Once you reach the bottom of the steps, you hear the door slam shut above you.)//???: Hello Master.//(You turn and see the ghost of a teenage boy. His image flickers, and his body looks thin, scrawny, on the edge of emaciated. Half his face is covered in angry red scarring, with dry patches where layers of skin are seared away pockmarking his cheeks and forehead.//Suddenly you remember who he is. The SERVANT. The one who never seemed to be able to meet your standards, whether it was the temperature of your tea or sneaking off the grounds when he wasn’t working.)//You…?//SERVANT: Yes. Me, master. Don’t you remember what happened here?//(Your memory is fuzzy. You get vague pangs of heat, loud crackling, the smell of something off. Of a scream for help. You remember the diary pages, with the accounts of what you did to the SERVANT. How you treated him. Of the electric problems in the house.)//A… a fire. I remember a fire.//SERVANT: Yes. //(You begin putting the pieces together.)//A fire started in the living room. Because the wiring hadn’t been working recently near the fireplace. And you--//SERVANT: I didn’t survive. I died choking on smoke, feeling the most searing, excruciating pain. //And it was my fault… I… I’d locked you into your room.//SERVANT: Yes. I’m glad you remember.//I…/What was your name?//(The SERVANT freezes for a moment, confused and unprepared for the question. He looks down sadly.)//SERVANT: I… I don’t remember… //(Your head hurts, but you are trying your very best to remember.)//It…/It was…//[1] Samuel  [2] Freddy
N ///Freddy. It was Freddy.//(Freddy looks up at you, his tortured gaze softening. He smiles softly. He goes to speak but you cut him off;)//I’m sorry, Freddy./I really am. //(He stands there looking at you for a moment. He slowly approaches you before putting his hand on your shoulder.)//Freddy: Thank you, Nathan. /Freddy: You did well.//[1] Wake up. //[2] Wake up.
NY ///(You suddenly burst awake. You open your eyes to find yourself staring at an unfamiliar ceiling. For the first time, you feel relieved that it’s not a place you vaguely recognize.//You sit up slowly, feeling sharp pains across your body.//You look around and find yourself in a hospital bed, filled with “Get well Soon!” cards and flowers, and a muted television playing a mundane hallmark movie.//You feel guilty and bad.//You also feel forgiven.//You look out the window.//It starts to rain.) //[1] The end!

Y ///Was it… Samuel?//(The SERVANT looks at you, pained.)//???: …No, that doesn’t feel right…//(You feel worse. )//I’m sorry I couldn’t remember./And… for everything.//(The SERVANT’s expression softens and he looks up at you. He takes a moment before finally responding.)//???: Thank you./???: For trying. /???: I hope you learned something from this.//[1] Wake up. [2] Wake up.
